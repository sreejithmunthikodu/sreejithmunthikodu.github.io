title: Basic Descriptive Statistics
---

This article is written in an attempt to help review the basic concepts in descriptive statistics. It may help aspiring data scientists with little or no statistics background to get familiar with descriptive statistics. Unlike inferential statistics, which use samples to generalize information about the populations from which the samples were drawn from, descriptive statistics summarize only the sample. Toy datasets are used in this article to demonstrate summarizing the data with descriptive statistics tools. The first dataset used is from a hypothetical survey conducted among 150 randomly selected small towns. The data matrix is shown below. Here temperature denotes the average annual temperature, precipitation the annual precipitation, language the most often used language, and income the average annual household income.
